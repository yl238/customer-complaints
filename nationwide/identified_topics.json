BIG Mistake. I complete the account application and not required to go to a branch for identity checks etc.  Probably because I paid off my mortgage with them some years previously.  I receive an email which addressed me by my surname only i.e. no Mr or Dear Iain.  Anyway I receive another email the next day (7th) saying my account was accepted and the switch was starting.  Then yet another email telling me the switch was underway (8th) and I would receive a bank card and stuff as you do.  So, under the switch guarantee it would complete on the 16th (yesterday).But it did not and I was still waiting for my card, pin number and password for online banking.  I later find 2 emails in my spam folder with dire warnings by Google not to open them.  I go ahead and they tell me the switch is going to be completed on the 20th.  If I do not agree I am to call them.So I do and sincerely wish I had not.  The call handler, Jack, was seriously lacking in customer service.  Not once did I get an apology and he was hell bent on getting me off the line.  He told me that the delay is for security reasons (ah, that good all rounder) on my application and very conveniently this comes to 4 days.  Except I have already been accepted but he does not want to hear this.  I become frustrated with his evasiveness and he says he will end the call because I am being hostile.  I did not swear or raise my voice, merely enquiring as to whether he had done arithmetic at school as 7 working days added to the 8th means switch completion on the 16th (7 working days).  I ask to speak to a supervisor and he refuses outright.  Another request is refused but he will take details for a complaint.  After 51 minutes and 7 seconds I end the call.Today, I attempt to register for online banking although I have still NOT received a card reader.  I go through the process and then try to log on.  I have done something wrong so I do it again.  And again and now I am locked out.  I call customer 'services' and explain so she looks it up.  Yes, you have entered the pass number incorrectly.  Okay, so can you reset it and I'll get it right this time.  Oh no.  As you have just registered, it will be 8 days until you can try again.  WHAT???  But, she offers me a solution, I can go into a branch and get a card reader instantly.  Fortunately I am retired so I can find the time to travel to the next city, find a parking space and walk through the town and go to a branch.  What if I had been working?  Hmmm......I haven't even switched and already fed up with this lot.   Their attitude on the phone is confrontational - customers, who needs them? - and while I had problems with First Direct, at least they were pleasant and polite when explaining their cock ups.  Unfortunately, I cannot cancel the switch as it has now started.

I tell them, they've done this before for me, from same account, they still refuse. I ask to see the manager - they refuse. they even dare to tell me not to raise my voice, or they will throw me out!!! What happened, to the customer is always right? I say, okay then it says on your website that I can withdraw up to \u00a310,000 in cash, \"no, not doing that either.\" finally as another employee intervenes they grudingly agree to write a cheque that I then have to go physically pay into my bank. I then discover that the cheque will not clear untill wednesday or thursday of next week, thus meaning my dog can't be collected from vet untill then, and I will now incur further costs from vet.

Getting the account set up took weeks - I was switching from Lloyds. Also getting a card reader was a nightmare - after multiple phone calls I eventually resorted to going into a branch to pick one up. The sign up process is also really outdated and requires bringing ID to branch - something you can do electronically with other banks like Metro. The website is also very old fashioned and isn't designed for mobiles which is a pain as you need to use it for things like amending standing orders. I think Nationwide should close down the website and become app only as this would force them to get the service right, rather than maintaining a second rate old platform. I've also found that I have to enter my pin much more frequently then with other banks, and recently was unable to get cashback at a supermarket - but had no problem with another bank card. Also while the app is generally very good, it's really frustrating pending transactions are anonymised, and a really poor protection against potential fraud. It's also annoying that you get a warning about being in your overdraft for every online transfer you make when already overdrawn. Saying all that the app is actually pretty good and has a handy quick balance feature which doesn't require login. You can also set up fingerprint login. Also the staff I've spoken to are friendly and they do pick up the phone quickly. And here's the thing - their overdraft rates are ridiculously cheap - I'm talking literally hundreds less per annum then Lloyd's, plus no charges at all in the first year. So if you have a largish overdraft you will save hundreds. In fact this is exactly why I didn't go with banks who have joining offers, as I calculated that what I would save far exceeded even the most generous sign up offer.Saying that if you do have a friend with Nationwide they also offer a decent sign up offer for referrals - I just didn't know anyone who banked with them - so cannot really comment on this.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.28739649864182815}, "1": {"topic_idx": 32, "topic_name": "Overdraft balance and fees", "topic_prob": 0.13303030986967848}, "2": {"topic_idx": 5, "topic_name": "Access to bank account", "topic_prob": 0.12911863608893825}, "3": {"topic_idx": 16, "topic_name": "Terms and conditions of accounts", "topic_prob": 0.12303238971540545}, "4": {"topic_idx": 14, "topic_name": "Customer service", "topic_prob": 0.12217848910650982}}}, {"Original narrative": "Wanted to open a Flex Direct account...that was 11 days ago.

I notified the bank 3 times (once on phone and twice in the Barnstaple branch) and even got their Fraud Dept involved who told me that as the account was both signatures needed in branch, the account was water tight.  That's right, Nationwide told me the accounts were WATER TIGHT.  They put flags on the account that later transpired where only on my signatures and not the grandmother so they didn't show up on grandmothers accounts saying she couldn't withdraw.  My delightful mother (grandmother) withdrew \u00a3500 from both accounts and had two cheques raised valuing \u00a33800.  When I complained (I was shaking with shock when  I discovered what they had allowed to happen) - I drove straight to the branch) they told me that it was down to 'human error'.  It hadn't happened just the once,  but two times.  Can you believe that having been told by their own Fraud Dept that the children's accounts were water tight, they were woefully not water tight.I was offered \u00a375 and they refused to refund the monies. I therefore contacted the FOS and after 6 months the  FOS findings sided with Nationwide.  It was human error. When I challenged their report they  just stuck to their guns and reitterated it was 'human error'.  The accounts were frozen and now the children will not be able to access their money until the old bag dies or I go to court to have her removed off the accounts.I then wrote to the CEO Joe Garner about the matter and after speaking with one of his complaints agents, I presented them with a list of questions to put to their legal dept including that my mother had breached the T&Cs of the account, her theft from the account etc etc.  Yet again, same record.  It was human error and the matter was closed.  All they could further add was that it was a civil matter.Every person  who I know who has worked in banking or law has told  me that Nationwide should have reimbursed the money and then chased my mother to repay them and their costs.I now have to go to the small claims court to get the money back from my mother, and god help me,  I hope the legal system is better than the FOS, as I haven't the money for litigation.  I'm hoping that if I win, I will be able to apply to the courts to have my mother removed from the accounts, shut them down and put the money elsewhere.  This is now the 11th month I am trying to get this resolved.

As soon as you make an online account, they do not send out bank statements. If asking them for a statement, you have to pay a minimum fee of \u00a35. However, what may explain why funds are missing from accounts is an e-mail I received from Nationwide Building Society recently. The e-mail I received confirmed that there is a \"lending\" scheme. This scheme involved money mysteriously disappearing from accounts, to therefore fund towards others (who may have more money, and can afford to pay loans back) that would like to withdraw a loan from the bank. this means they have no consideration for those with little money in their accounts.The problem with this is that I would never be interested in taking a loan out from Nationwide, as my credit score is average, and my annual income is little, I would never be able to take out a loan or pay it back. I do not understand why this e-mail was sent to me, as they can see it does not appeal to me and my funds. Unless, they decided to eventually explain themselves as to why money disappears. Anything from \u00a310 - \u00a350 can disappear from my account at any one time. Despite them calling this a lending scheme, they never pay it back. And if making an enquiry, they only pay back the admission fee (which is \u00a39), for investigating the missing money and its status. Another problem I have experienced, is if your card is either lost/stolen more than twice in a period of several years, they threaten to block the user's account, and blatantly refuse to send out another card.A problem my family has faced, is a few years ago it was stated on the news, that if there is more than so many hundred or thousand in an account that has not been used between 5-10 years, they take the money without any inform or consent. My elderly aunt was forced to withdraw her savings from her account, as she did not want to lose all that she had saved with Nationwide. This is awful, as there is no security for those who do intend to have a savings account for a rainy day. If an account has not been accessed, added to or any money has been withdrawn within a certain time frame, they just steal it.

He has a disability and he asked that I should have oversight and control of his accounts so that I could ensure that his finances were proper, money was in the right place at the right time and that bills were paid on time.I contacted Nationwide and was advised to get a General Power of Attorney - a simple document signed by the donor and a witness authorising this sort of financial access.Nationwide have a process for General Power of Attorney - (just search for Nationwide Power of Attorney) - and it's easy to draw one up. I used an online lawyer website to do this.My son duly signed and the neighbour witnessed the document.I was troubled when Nationwide said that the document needed to be signed by the attorney (me). In English law, it does not.My son and I took the document into a meeting at the local branch to set up the right accounts for him. I produced the document which was looked upon askance by the employee we were meeting.She said she had \"never seen one like that\", passed it to her manager who spent 10 minutes trying to get through to their Head Office Power of Attorney department  who then rejected it. No explanation, they just rejected it.So I opened a joint account - not what we really wanted as it doesn't really cover my son's savings and assets.He also ended up not opening a student account which, but for his disability, would have been the right choice. So he now doesn't get the benefits of a student account because Nationwide refused the GPoA so I can't get access on my son's behalf as his attorney to provide the support he needs.With a GPoA this would have been accessible, so this is disability discrimination. They failed to accept the GPoA which would have allowed my son to have a student account. They refused, effectively, a reasonable adjustment.When I got home, fuming, I contacted a Legal Executive (high powered solicitor) in a highly respected firm of lawyers, experienced in probate and powers of attorney. She was baffled. I sent her a scan of the GPoA and she replied regarding this matter and the attached document ...\"The General Powers that we prepare are only ever signed by the donor (not the attorney as well). I can\u2019t see anything wrong with it so I too would be interested to know Nationwide\u2019s reasons for rejecting it.\"So I started a complaint process, but it take 7 days to get a reply. Meanwhile Nationwide replied on their messaging service ...\"I've spoken with our Power to Attorney team for you to see if there is anything else we can do to help support you and your son. They have said that providing the document for your General Power of Attorney document is witnessed and has In the High court of printed on your document then this would be accepted\"However in England it's not part of the process for a General Power of Attorney to be registered with a court.So there is no process for getting a GPoA registered, which means that Nationwide are in effect not accepting GPoA's.The statements that Nationwide have made about the attorney signing and it being registered with a court apply to Lasting Powers of Attorney not General Powers of Attorney.It's also possible that Scottish or Northern Irish law may be different in this area, but I'm in England.So the upshot is that I can't get Nationwide to accept a General Power of Attorney even though they say they do.It feels like Nationwide aren't listening to me on this. I feel like screaming. None of this is helping my son and he goes to university in 2 weeks time. I am so worried about him.This has so soured my relationship with Nationwide. They need to sort it now. I will take this to the Ombudsman if necessary.Update: I've filed a complaint with the Ombudsman. Nationwide have 8 weeks to give their final reply after which the Ombudsman will investigate.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.28434194526487755}, "1": {"topic_idx": 31, "topic_name": "Legal documents", "topic_prob": 0.2550237132040989}, "2": {"topic_idx": 28, "topic_name": "Legal complaints", "topic_prob": 0.20001493060073722}, "3": {"topic_idx": 14, "topic_name": "Customer service", "topic_prob": 0.08590206980151706}, "4": {"topic_idx": 29, "topic_name": "Opening or closing account", "topic_prob": 0.0670022413791207}}}, {"Original narrative": "I have my mortgage, credit card, current account, travel insurance, car loan etc with NATIONWIDE.

I looked on your website for some simple information as to whether or not your Flexaccount accepts payments by BACS. You know, one of the largest payment methods around.I couldn't find any mention of it anywhere. So I try ringing up the customer helpline line only to be told that the minimum waiting time is 30 mins on hold for a customer service agent.You'd be forgiven for thinking that with 18,000 employees that somebody would be available to answer the phone, but no. Alexander Graham Bell must be turning in his grave somewhere.I then rang the customer complaints line and managed to speak to a Nationwide employee firstly about the absence of information and secondly about the absence of service.I was told that I would be contacted in response to my concerns. At 2 pm today 07.06.18 I was contacted by someone claiming to be from Nationwide.I informed them that as I was in a public place and thus I was unable to participate in the call and it was agreed that they would ring me back at 3 pm.At 2.50 pm I ensured that I was somewhere that I could receive Nationwide's call, after waiting for 35 minutes I received no call. At 3.25 pm I was forced to leave that location and thus was once again unavailable to participate in any calls from Nationwide.I contacted Nationwide again, this evening at approximately 6.30 pm and asked the customer complaints line as to why I was not telephoned at 3 pm as agreed. I also added that I had made an effort to make myself available for them and that i had been both disappointed and inconvenienced by their inability to to keep their promises.The customer service agent informed me that the agent who was going to call me had been busy on another call. When I enquired as to why someone else hadn't made the call instead I was instructed that only that particular case worker could call me.Now in industry terms, that situation is what's referred to as a 'single point of failure', i.e. if this one person in an organisation of 18,000 employees is not available to do the task, then the task does not get done.At this point I began to despair as I realised that I was going to be forced to raise a second complaint about the handling of my first complaint.Thus I informed the customer service agent that there was nothing that Nationwide could now do to salvage its reputation so instead they should bother me no more. Upon reflection, perhaps Nationwide should do something constructive with that \u00a31 Billion pounds of underlying profit that they made, partly from my money, in 2017, such as:1.

My accounts have always been in credit and the only problem I ever had was when I recommend my daughter but we didn\u2019t receive the introduction fee but I sorted that, eventually.Recently I wanted to borrow some money to buy a car. I looked at several options and finally it was between Lloyds Bank or Nationwide. I chose Nationwide based on their claim to get the money into my account within 2 hours. I filled in the online application form and all appeared to be okay. I was told that if I accepted their offer they would do a credit check and it would be on my record. I know my credit rating is more than good so I went ahead. It was implied that I had completed the process. I watched for the money to come into my account but nothing arrived. I was a bit concerned but the next day I received an email to say they were sending me a letter. Why they didn\u2019t just send an email or use my account messaging function on the internet site I don\u2019t know. The letter arrived a few days later and asked for proof of income. No problem except they wanted original documentation and in paper form, I have a paperless account wherever possible, including at Nationwide. I took a 30 mile round trip to my other bank and got statements printed. I then went, as invited to do, to the Nationwide branch. They were so rude I was really upset. I am obviously disabled, with a walking aide and I was in pain. I was expected to stand at the counter while the clerk complained about me not arranging the loan on Branch and how she could only send the paperwork off when she had the time and she wouldn\u2019t comment or advise me as to whether I had submitted the right documents. She was so rude and when I went to sit down she insisted I should come back to th counter. She never offered me a seat or enquired if I was okay. I insisted on seeing the manager who eventually popped her head around a doorway and shouted across at me that they would send my paperwork off to the loans department when they have time. I was furious and shouted back that I would take this further. The manager then came from behind the counter and spoke to me in public about my situation. I have lodge a complaint and cancelled the loan application. Nationwide\u2019s complaint procedure has added to the problem and the loan application required a further 9 month so of bank statements.

In short, I feel that they are vindictively interfering with my banking because I made a complaint.They were rude, dismissive and did not offer to refund insurance money, despite the fact that they had made a mess of the policy.Many, many issues later...Without warning I have been told it is illegal for me to use the online internet bank account details I registered in 2002. Apparently I have my own internet banking details (presumably provided via telepathic mind meld because both my partner and myself know only one set of internet banking details was given upon opening the account).So I have applied for these details an am now waiting, I would not be hopeful because they have, so far, got partner's mortgage application wrong, insured a house we don't own or rent and introduced new rules on our banking WITHOUT our permission.The latest wheeze is declining regular payments in a vindictive and ignorant manner to be annoying and cost us as much time and trouble as they can. They declined an Amazon payment this week I have been using Amazon as long as the account is open. The account had sufficient funds to process the payment.

Nationwide has a better ethical reputation than many banks. It's unfortunate that their customer support seems to be as corporatised and bad as with banks.Background: I have a mortgage on a home for my mother. For some reason Nationwide have always sent the paperwork for me to that address. It didn't seem to be a problem - I just collected it when I went round.They recently told me it could cause problems with another mortgage application and I had to update it (even though I'd never lived there or set that as my residential address anyway - it was purely a minor Nationwide mistake).I had some mildly frustrating phone calls to resolve it and eventually had to walk a couple of miles to my nearest branch to show them photo ID with my residential address on (an address they already had on record). After various phonecalls to get authorisation codes, the staff told me it was done.I got a letter yesterday confirming it. Except - it had the wrong house number. The number was from my mother's house, the road name my own. Luckily the postman knew which house I lived at.At this point I hardly raised an eyebrow. A minor inconvenience. My complaint isn't that a couple of small mistakes were made - it was the frustrating process of resolving them that left me increasingly angry and frustrated to the point where it wasted my day.First, I rang the number on the letter that I was told to ring if there were problems - their main customer support number 0800 30 20 11. Instead of a person, it was an infuriating menu of nested options, none of which were what I wanted. There was no option to speak to a person. I ended up after many options at a dead end where nothing applied. I hung up and tried again, twice, trying different options each time. None of them were related to what I was ringing up about. None led to an actual person. At this point I started getting annoyed.So I found a complaints number on their website and rang that. And it also led to an annoying multi-choice menu. I pressed random buttons until I got through to someone. I explained what had happened. I got as far as wanting to complain about the lack of an option to speak to a person on their main customer support number. I was put on hold. I waited. I waited. Silence. Eventually I hung up. I had got no further after over 20 minutes of phone calls and waiting.So I turned to social media, and asked the Nationwide UK Twitter account. I pointed out that the very first thing when a customer (or non-customer) rings their help number 0800 30 20 11 should be a clear option to speak to a person. Not all queries can be categorised.Their response. \"If you press option 2 then any option from there will be able to get through to someone who can help you.\"What? Option 2 is \"current accounts, internet banking and credit card enquiries\" - why would I choose that if it isn't related to what I'm ringing about? And how are people ringing up meant to know that they need to choose incorrect options to speak to a person? I pointed this out and said \"Please, if Nationwide must use frustrating menus, always include an 'other' option, or a 'speak to a person' option. I rang three times and ended up at dead ends each time.\"Anyway, I didn't get anywhere with either my complaint, or with getting their mistakes with my address corrected. So I switched to direct messages with them, as they requested (companies don't want potential customers to see that existing customers are unhappy).So, I summarised my complaints about their helpline again. I summarised the issue with them using the wrong address, again. They next tried to get me to go elsewhere - to register for Internet Banking, or to ring other phone numbers, or to try again and to press codes that aren't given in the menu. I pointed out I shouldn't have to - I'd informed them of all the issues. All they had to do was pass it up to someone higher up who could resolve them. Add an option to speak to a human, and change the house number of my address. I shouldn't need to verify anything again, or receive information - they had all they needed in the mortgage paperwork and my account. Any member of staff could look at those and see what the correct house number was (they had been using it for 18 years and sending other paperwork to it). They'd also seen two forms of photo ID with the correct address on. But the Nationwide staff refused to pass it on or act on it. I ended with:\"I'm not asking you to do anything through social media. Just get someone higher up to look at my mortgage account. They'll see that they have made a typo, it is xxx, not xxx. The address is already on our account. No need to divulge personal details. You already have them all. Thanks.\"So, multiple phone calls to different numbers, and other channels. And still no-one was going to fix their error. They would rather send private financial details to an address that they knew was wrong. I'm guessing I'll have to start this all over again, and they'll probably tell me to walk into town and show them the same ID all over again. Nationwide make mistakes and the onus, cost and hassle is all on the customer. By then I'd spent a long time on this, got angry, and still no nearer than getting them to fix a single number they had got wrong (again).Oh, despite all those contacts, no-one at Nationwide followed it up or rang me back (I was in my office all day; there were no messages or missed calls.) They all seemed to just write it off as something they wouldn't deal with.I realise the problem may not be the front-facing staff at Nationwide - they are just individuals told to follow scripts and have few powers to fix things. It is usually those higher up that create this system of help that can\u2019t help, and empty apologies in place of action, and mazes of support that make many people just give up., and hiding easy ways to contact people. For example, when a company sets up a contact system they _know_ people will often want to talk to a person. It is therefore a conscious decision not to include that option (a direct number, or making it the first menu option) \u2013 companies want to hide that, funnel you away, so you go away and there is less staff time cost for them. And that is the kind of decision that leads to crap support every step of the way, with people on the front line who can only repeat lines they\u2019re told and do nothing about it (or just refuse, it is unclear which in some cases). Just repeating \"we're sorry\" does not make it true. The only thing of relevance is to fix or change things. Otherwise they are just empty words.And so, after all that rigmarole that left me frustrated, all that wasted time, they would rather ignore the issues I raised and send personal financial information to an address they know is wrong than fix things, or make it easy to get them fixed. That's what disappointed me most.UPDATE 13th April 2018:I've now removed another star - it was originally a 2* review. But to try and sort all this out my girlfriend made a trip into town to our local Nationwide branch today, and took all the paperwork and photo ID with the correct address on. And the Nationwide staff refused to change the incorrect house number (even thought there is no #5 on our road). For some utterly bizarre reason they said it had to be done on the phone by us, they would not do it, even though they had the photo ID and address in front of them (which a phone person would not), and when all this hassle was caused by trying to use their stupid phone system in the first place with its irrelevant menus, dead ends, and cutting off.So a series of mistakes by Nationwide has wasted the better part of a couple of days for us, and is still not resolved. They actually don't want to fix their errors, and would rather send paperwork to a non-existent address that they have made up. All the onus is placed on the victims of their errors, and even then we got nowhere. Two days. It's when you run into problems (made by the company itself) that you really see how unhelpful they are. As it is I give up. Let them send things to the wrong place. It isn't worth this much stress.UPDATE 16th April 2018:Nationwide rang me - though not on the number I list as my preferred phone number. Didn't get very far because they record conversations by default, and the customer has no say over whether that happens or not, or how the data is used, or how long it is stored for. I said I wasn't happy with being recorded and they refused to stop recording, so the call had to be terminated. It's as if they are actually trying to come up with new ways to be awkward.UPDATE 22nd April 2018:I had been contacted by Nationwide's \"Customer Consultant, Digital Service\" (on 15th April) who said \"I would love to assist you further with your query, however, I am unable to access any information regarding the link you have provided in your message.\" That made no sense - I had linked to this review with all the details. Are they unable to visit a website? They did not reply to my request for clarification.Separately from that I was contacted by Nationwide's \"Customer Service Executive\" on 14th April. They said they would \"ring you Monday 10-8 or Tuesday 10-6\". I avoided going out just in case they rang. Guess what? No phone calls, no messages. They didn't bother to follow it up.Weeks down the line and all they've done is waste time and refuse to change a single house number in my address from a non-existent one they made up to the correct one which was on all the photo ID I'd shown them and which was already on their other records. They must have money to waste if they choose to drag out these kinds of simple things that should be fixable in seconds - instead we get epic scales of frustration and wasted time and resources. Unbelievable.UPDATE 30th April 2018:Nationwide responded by letter and acknowledged some of my points - I added 1*.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.3003374178554396}, "1": {"topic_idx": 14, "topic_name": "Customer service", "topic_prob": 0.2629564784328599}, "2": {"topic_idx": 25, "topic_name": "Communication by phone", "topic_prob": 0.18869851206236313}, "3": {"topic_idx": 1, "topic_name": "Communications with company", "topic_prob": 0.06098860974245699}, "4": {"topic_idx": 2, "topic_name": "Signing contracts", "topic_prob": 0.03335240567360569}}}, {"Original narrative": "How can a Company get simple details wrong  so many times.

We arrived early today and quickly realised that they had got my husband's name wrong, first mistake.Just after the appointed time we sat before a screen and the process of opening the accounts began, within minutes we felt that this way of opening an account was not the best experience in the world made more complicated by the fact that the person dealing with us was not English and there were communication problems given that the persons first language was not English.The process for opening the account was long and intense, my husband wanted a simple uncomplicated account with no overdraft into which his monthly salary would be paid and standing orders/direct debits paid out. About 30 minutes into the process having answered all of the questions we were advised that my husband's application was approved and details of his current bank and his account numbers etc were provided for the switch to take place.Five minutes later the bank representative advised that the application could not be approved until head office had made a decision- no explanation for this sudden change was offered and my husband was told that he would be informed in about five days as to whether the Nationwide would approve his application!!My husband has always had stable employment and is currently a senior executive with a multi national company and receives a substantial salary for his job which is paid directly into his bank account.We have a mortgage which is fully paid in 22 month, there has never been any arrears on the mortgage.He holds a bank card and credit cards, his credit card is paid off in full each month.He has never been overdrawn at his current bank, despite all of this and his being a model potential customer the Nationwide treated him like a petty criminal who had intentions to defraud the bank.The length of time taken to conduct this farce meant the we ran out of time to open the joint account so left feeling frustrated and insulted by the attitude of the Nationwide organisation.As a direct result my husband decided not to continue with his application and I will now move my own accounts in protest, in fact I will move them to the bank my husband is currently with - how is that or irony.Whilst we appreciate the need for financial organisations to operate in accordance with government requirements and there are clear procedures the Nationwide goes way beyond what is considered necessary by most financial institutions, they clearly feel that acceptance of an application to open an account is a privilege which they exercise and as such their procedures are designed to actively discourage people. We suspect that the reason for this back pedalling was because the bank did not think they could make any money from my husband given the account he chose and his request not to have an overdraft facility.Our advice is to avoid the organisation and find a bank/building society which is glad to accept new customers and puts their interests first. The Nationwide is a disgrace and does not deserve to prosper I look forward to the day when their poor business practice brings about their downfall.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.29758578310248046}, "1": {"topic_idx": 5, "topic_name": "Access to bank account", "topic_prob": 0.15648134365569497}, "2": {"topic_idx": 29, "topic_name": "Opening or closing account", "topic_prob": 0.13209814183465685}, "3": {"topic_idx": 12, "topic_name": "Mortgage loan modifications", "topic_prob": 0.08542199471631033}, "4": {"topic_idx": 14, "topic_name": "Customer service", "topic_prob": 0.07869637881933768}}}, {"Original narrative": "PLEASE DON'T USE THIS COMPANYI am now classed as \"homeless\" :(Listen to what people are saying on these reviews.

I am now housebound and totally dependent on online banking (particularly debit card payment) for all my outgoing payments.All seemed to go well until November 2016, when Nationwide took exception to my paying \u00a3600 for a new bed and bedding from Argos. They did so even when I tried to make the payment again through PayPal, which alone should have told them that it was genuine. They cancelled my debit card and thus left me unable to make payments for several days hence unable to buy groceries or heating (see the forum.diabetes.org.uk thread \"Are they allowed to do this?\").Then, in December 2017, they flagged my Christmas shopping as \"unusual spending\" (well, duh) and blocked my card again. It took about two weeks to sort out.At the start of March 2018, they once more flagged up \"unusual spending\". This time it took four weeks (including my reminding them of my vulnerability) before they restored access to my money on the 4th April.About 12 hours later, having finally found this out (they didn't email me as they were supposed to, I had to log in and check my messages), I paid some of the debts that had built up, and decided to celebrate by spending \u00a3600 on a late birthday present to myself. No, not allowed, even though again the payment attempt was through PayPal and its tight security, so that alone should have told them it was genuine.They sent me a PM early this morning querying the purchase, and I responded pointing out the urgency of the situation, and that I should not have to keep doing this. Near the close of the business day they still hadn't bothered to correct their error, so I sent another PM.Still no response, and extrapolating from the trend the next unblock will probably last 3 hours before I am blocked off from my money again.

They are not fit to sit the right way round on a toilet seat, let alone handle billions of pounds of mortgages. No wonder we have credit crunches. Nationwide seem to think that they don't have to supply any sort of useful service whatsoever and that business will continue to come to them as a big name.My experience has been absolutely appalling. After taking out a 25 year mortgage with my then girlfriend we decided to break up. We made the agreement that I would continue to pay the mortgage and pay her rent.A year after that I decided to take on the mortgage myself and to take on her half of the flat and pay her the difference. At first Nationwide said it was an affordable option for me, so I went in and made all arrangements to take it on. At the final stage after weeks of effort and ringing they said that the mortgage was no longer affordable because of my credit rating and to try again in 6 months time. I improved my credit rating and came back in 6 months time having also reduced the mortgage amount with over-payments of 10% of the mortgage. Again they said I would be able to take on the mortgage and after dousens of calls, documents and having been juggled around with loads of different staff members so that no one knew my case they again (having initially said that I could take on the mortgage alone) turned my down. I made another over-payment which totally cleared out my savings and reapplied - they eventually got the thing through after I had rung them every day for two weeks having to deal with a different person each time (where you have to explain the entire problem again) and having to deal with 5 to 10 minute call wait times as they do not assign allow you to call your designated mortgage consultant. When they accepted the mortgage they accepted it for the original higher amount before the final overpayment which was an accident by them. This meant I had to chase them for a further two weeks to get them to change it to the amount of the outstanding mortgage. I am at this stage now an I have had enough. I think I will re mortgage with a different bank or building society that has a different approach to their customers who are paying them huge amounts of money over huge periods of time. This has cost me a lot of money in a. the price of the house going up and b. the rent that my ex is putting on it and has in total cost me over \u00a35000 because they couldn't make up their minds to allow me to take on a mortgage alone that I was paying already.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.36529449003312187}, "1": {"topic_idx": 8, "topic_name": "Taking out or refinancing mortgage", "topic_prob": 0.23269490700972872}, "2": {"topic_idx": 11, "topic_name": "Issues with payments", "topic_prob": 0.10433659374196705}, "3": {"topic_idx": 20, "topic_name": "Interest rates", "topic_prob": 0.10159647552642566}, "4": {"topic_idx": 12, "topic_name": "Mortgage loan modifications", "topic_prob": 0.05580604754579131}}}, {"Original narrative": "Been with them for years and put up with minor issues.

They quoted 90 minutes but the truck was there in 20 minutes, it was all very easy.

So far I have had to complain about them on three separate occasions.

They needed ID but never sent any communication asking me to bring it in. They left the account open and stopped the switch without telling me. I had been given a closing date so on that date I moved money into the account to pay my regular direct debits. These had not been moved so all bounced an incurred charges at my old bank. It took ages to sort the problem as their complaints department are really hard to get hold of. By the time it was sorted they told me that as it had taken so long I was no longer entitled to the switching bonus through refer a friend.Next they decided to reduce my overdraft by \u00a31250. They apparently sent me a letter informing me of this change. A letter that was sent to a past address (an address that had a royal mail redirect on it so still should have got to me). the first I heard of this was when the collections team got in contact as I had been over my limit for months. I had logged into online banking several times during this time and there had been no indication that I was over. They forced me into repayment despite being over the limit being down to their lack of communication. After a long complaint I was refunded the fines but the repayments remained on my credit score. They did not inform me that this world be the case and this mark has since prevented me from getting a mortgage. After many complaints I have since been told that they feel that this situation was my fault and not theirs. I am currently complaining to the financial ombudsman as I feel this is unacceptable.

Once the switch is completed (I wonder if that'll happen this year) I'll give it a couple of months and if I keep having problems I will close my account and never look back.UPDATE: I am still with Nationwide and now even have a joint account which was actually really quick and easy to set up hence the extra star. Unfortunately this doesn't make up for the experience I've had the first time round. It should also be said that while it was relatively stress free the second time round, it still wasn't perfect, e.g. thanks to confusing text messages, one of them saying thanks for sending in your passport (I hadn't) but we still need you to send in the signed T's&C's (how about providing them then, or letting me know where I can find them and how I send them in?).", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.4663708380657773}, "1": {"topic_idx": 29, "topic_name": "Opening or closing account", "topic_prob": 0.17078209748554857}, "2": {"topic_idx": 16, "topic_name": "Terms and conditions of accounts", "topic_prob": 0.09022413749836122}, "3": {"topic_idx": 14, "topic_name": "Customer service", "topic_prob": 0.08369838994171007}, "4": {"topic_idx": 25, "topic_name": "Communication by phone", "topic_prob": 0.04877323952253482}}}, {"Original narrative": "My account has been accessed by someone after cloning/taking my credentials, the thief then made transactions on my account on Xmas day, so i call on Xmas day for support and THEY ARE CLOSED because of course why would you have a fraud department open during Xmas.So i wait until the 27th ( the transactions were still pending back then) so that i can get hold of ANYBODY from their fraud department, but by then some of the transactions of course start to go through.So i dispute the transactions that went through before canceling my card.Three weeks later and 2 disputes and many phone calls later, they will not refund me at all because the person who did purchases did so by faking my IP address as well so based on that, it must have been me who tried to buy random stuff from Amazon and Game repeatedly for days in a row and must have been still me who did another 40+ transactions to the same websites even AFTER my card was cancelled.And then the fraud person who talked to me tells me i have quite some money on my account ( 4000 pounds roughly) rather implying that i wont miss the 70 pounds that were taken from me and that they wont refund me cause it was me who bought random stuff off the internet.Thanks for the new card you sent me, I will be moving to another bank and warning everyone i know about this bank.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 42, "topic_name": "Fraudulent transaction", "topic_prob": 0.6896808623612237}, "1": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.11597416756728364}, "2": {"topic_idx": 29, "topic_name": "Opening or closing account", "topic_prob": 0.08853401785210531}, "3": {"topic_idx": 25, "topic_name": "Communication by phone", "topic_prob": 0.05250536970572806}, "4": {"topic_idx": 1, "topic_name": "Communications with company", "topic_prob": 0.01389112637650041}}}, {"Original narrative": "I'm extremely happy with Nationwide for the following reasons:1.

Since I took the mortgage out my wages have increased, my outgoings have reduced, I am debt free and my credit score is 999. After completing a ton of forms and having to attend a lengthy meeting with an advisor in branch I was told that I would be contacted within 48 hours with a decision. The guy never contacted me again. I called a week later and was told that my application had been refused. I applied for a slightly bigger mortgage with Halifax which I was offered within a few days. No idea why Nationwide refused me.With the xmas holidays there has been a 2 month wait for the Halifax mortgage to be completed. So I called Nationwide and went through changing the direct debit details from my ex wife's account to mine. At the end of the month I received a letter telling me that direct debit payment had failed and my account was in arrears. Of course they had failed in the simple task of changng the direct debit and were still using my ex wifes details (she had cancelled her direct debit). They had also reported the late payment to credit agents so my credit score was now damaged.I went through a lengthy phone call, made payment with my debit card, recieved apoligies, was told that the late payment would be removed from my credit report and assured everything was sorted.Sure enough, exactly the same thing has happened this month.

It's actually terrible. First they messed up by never sending me a switching code, which is used to verify that you've referred someone to get the bonus. By their own records, the lack of a switch code means that no referral has ever taken place, and Nationwide are incredibly reluctant to do anything about this to help you with their mistake. Instead of looking into the issue in any meaningful way, they've just asked me to repeatedly resend the form to my friend to complete (which I've done, and yet it still 'does not work') and refuse to accept culpability for anything else.Following on from that, there's been a series of technical hiccups which Nationwide seem resistant to own on their side with their refer a friend forms displaying as expired when sent to my referees, or simply not working at all. Their customer service team also have a tendency towards contradicting themselves; my friend was told that she could still get the bonus by completing her switch over the phone, I've been told that's not true and that the only way to get the bonus is through the form. Having known from the beginning that we were given incorrect information, maybe we could've avoided all this back and forth? Who knows.I've been trying to deal with this for over a month now. It's frustrating. When I first called up for help, the phone line queues were 15+ minutes long and I was soon redirected to using the Secure Messaging service instead, which takes about 2 working days longer than calling for help. After all this back and forth for a week, I gave up to complain on Twitter. Now here's where things speed up slightly. The moment you complain or kick up a fuss on Twitter they jump at the opportunity to correct the issue. Unfortunately, trying to resolve the issue over Twitter means a lot of repeating yourself as multiple members of their team operate the account and will jump into the conversation to help. If you follow this route, be prepared to explain the problem at least 3 times with different varieties of words before someone understands the issue.I'm tired. I really thought it'd be an easy process and I don't understand how this many mistakes can be made. I'll give Nationwide 2 stars simply for the fact that, right now, they offer the best regular savers and current account deals on the market. They lose 3 stars for their terrible customer service who just repeat choice troubleshooting lines and don't seem capable to actually resolve anything. This has soured me enough that I'll just switch to get the hell away from them.

I have always been under the impression that the Nationwide were different to most high street banks/building societies in that their customer service was better and that you were valued as a customer.It would seem that they are no different to the rest. If you happen to be going through a period of financial difficulty it would appear that they simply do not care. Woe betide you if you miss a direct debit/standing order due to lack of funds ! Seemingly this justifies slapping fees and charges up to \u00a370 (!) a time on your account ! When asked how they could possibly justify such ludicrous charges, for something that hasn't happened and presumably has cost them nothing (!?), they simply spout T & C's at you, with no attempt to justify their daylight robbery. Occasionally, their fees and charges lead to other DD's not going out, hence leading to more issues with payees and yes you guessed it, more fees and charges ! And then there's the other old chestnut of slapping a charge on your account, taking you into unauthorized overdraft territory, therefore giving them the opportunity to charge you for that too ! When asked for a modest overdraft facility to help me out, which would benefit them too in terms of interest, they turned me down.If, like me you are under the impression that the nationwide are a more customer friendly, caring place to bank, as they would have you believe, don't believe a word of it. They are as bad as all the others when it comes to their greed. It's a one way street, we'll help ourselves to what we want but unless you have a healthy bank balance, we're not helping you !UpdateOh, quelle suprise, Nationwide applied a charge to my account, even though there was not enough money to cover it thus putting me into an unauthorised overdraft...........for which they will now charge me !Onthe subject of the \u00a370 charges mentioned above, when I complained recently, the customer service advisor told me that I would not be charged that much in future as the law had changed and they were not allowed to charge me more than \u00a340, as they they were doing me a favour ! Oh, so now you can't get away with ripping me off to the same extent, only because the law has changed !So, if there's not enough money in your account to cover a direct debit or standing order and you have no overdraft, it would appear that said dd or SO will not get paid. If however you do not have enough in your account to cover one of Nationwides random, plucked from thin air fees, they WILL take it out ! Proof that banks/building societies are only in it for their own benefit & couldn't give a %$!\u00a3 about their customers !Just paid in a cheque (from Barclays bank) only to be told that it will take 5 working days to clear, before I have access to the funds ! FIVE DAYS for a cheque to clear, in 2018 ! If it were a personal cheque I could maybe at a stretch understand but a cheque from another high street bank !Apparently being taken into an unauthorised overdraft (even if it's only \u00a325) due to Nationwide helping themselves to fees even though you have no money to cover them, now results in a black mark on your credit file !

We knew this because we'd had valuations from other surveyors. We went through a ridiculous appeals process and eventually, nationwide admitted they got it wrong and eventually got another surveyor to value the house correctly. you would think that would be the end of it... nope. They did a very poor job of continuing with our old mortgage and didn't switch our account to our new mortgage term. There were several phone calls, basically telling them how to do their job. It seems to me that they rely heavily on their computers to work for them and they can't seem to keep up with things. 3 months since we started the remortgage process, we are still waiting for them to activate our product switch.

Nationwide online systems are so poor and confusing.Myself and my partner applied for a mortgage in principle and went though all the checks and at the end were taken to a page that stated how much we could borrow and then onto a page that looked like it was requesting information for an actual mortgage application. The top of the page showed a progress tracker that clearly highlighted we had a mortgage in principle and the next stage was to get a mortgage. Worried that we received no official looking document that said we indeed had a mortgage in principle, we e-mail Nation wide. After several confusing e-mails we were told that we do indeed have one.It was only until we had an offer on a house and made a mortgage appointment in branch that we chase up the fact we needed a mortgage in principle document so we could take the house off the market. A phone call revealed that we did not have a decision in principle as although we passed the credit checks, they wanted a bunch of documentation as we made an entry into a box that was not clearly labelled as a possible change of income, it simply stated changes in outgoings so we put in commuting costs.We supplied the necessary documents and were told we would hear in 2 days which was a Thursday by 1.30 so we ended up getting a decision in principle from Halifax for the estate agent that took all of 10 minutes. We still wanted to apply for a Nationwide mortgage. After they 2 days passed, we called them again and were told to wait another day and that they would call us.Friday we still hadn't had a call so we rang again and were told we would definitely have a decision by 3.30 on Monday. That time went yet again so another call and were told to wait yet another day.When they finally got round to seeing our decision in principle, apparently figures we had entered for student loans were wrong but were not told how, everytime I asked a rude lady just said they were wrong and not being at all helpful, I would guess it would be something to do with a decimal place. Our address was wrong despite nationwide grabbing it from our current account details and my partner shouldn't have apparently entered in a yearly bonus for a job hes stated on the application that he had for a year as you need proof of 2, which was not mentioned in any information when applying. The lady on the phone was unwilling to help us in any way and was very dismissive of the fact we entered everything in correctly as was asked and the problem was on their end.Worrying that we would not be able to go in branch and have a mortgage appointment that we made on based on the fact we had a decision in principle, we rang the branch and we were literally told, just have another one at your mortgage appointment though there will be another credit check though your credit ratings are fine so you should be ok. Having another hard credit check on our file could be so damaging, specially if Nationwide mess up again which I really suspect they will and we need to apply for a mortgage with another provider in the hopes the sellers do not pull out as nationwide are taking so long to get the issue resolved.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.15240643281946215}, "1": {"topic_idx": 14, "topic_name": "Customer service", "topic_prob": 0.12009735014137365}, "2": {"topic_idx": 8, "topic_name": "Taking out or refinancing mortgage", "topic_prob": 0.10202255454117409}, "3": {"topic_idx": 39, "topic_name": "Contacting company", "topic_prob": 0.09895964900031767}, "4": {"topic_idx": 41, "topic_name": "Interests rates", "topic_prob": 0.08400281601690109}}}, {"Original narrative": "Hopeless.

They should really not be allowed to offer mortgages to the public.First their online application has flaws because it does not recognise all addresses and even though an address was manually entered correctly, on the review screen at the end of the application, it kindly removes part of what you entered, which creates problems later.  There is also no area to enter additional details that are important for the underwriters to know - e.g. change of employer's ownership, hence different payslip format on the 3 payslips uploaded.  Despite this, a letter with explanations on the address and change of employer ownership was also uploaded to them with other documents.  This was completely ignored.  A rather straight forward employed person application.There was absolutely no problem with any aspect of the applicant with credit history, salary or any other aspect, yet Nationwide and their hugely incompetent staff took 7 weeks to finalise the mortgage offer alone and by that time the home purchase and mortgage had been cancelled because of the hassles caused by them.  They also kindly ignored the cancellation of the mortgage and still sent documents by post with their very late mortgage offer.Their complaints process is also pathetic, because nothing gets done, even if they say that it will by a certain time.An example of their incompetence is having different teams of underwriters that see different information and do not communicate at all and when there is any issue, no-one picks up on this and lets the customer know about it.  Numerous times they had to be phoned up to ask them why things are not progressing and then they discover that their files show that they need another document or won't accept a document given to a branch that said it was 100% fine.  Each time something is done they take a whole week to then look at your application again, as it goes to the back of the pile.When they have all documents and the full application initially and assess it all, they should at that stage ask for whatever further information they need, but not Nationwide.   They ask then and the next week for more and the next week and so forth.  There is absolutely no intelligence in their methodology.I chose them because their interest rate and upfront charges were low and because they are a building society and offer the same product transfers in the future to existing customers and new ones, which a lot of banks do not.That is all pointless, as their initial service in the first place is so pathetic and has forced this purchase to fall through and no doubt many more will suffer the same fate.I can tell you that many high street banks like TSB, Halifax, Natwest and Santander would have processed this mortgage offer in under one week and some of them in the space of two days, not 7 weeks.For your own sake, please do not use Nationwide for a mortgage.Still never received any proper apology or acknowledgement of any wrongdoing by them.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 14, "topic_name": "Customer service", "topic_prob": 0.26103157325189297}, "1": {"topic_idx": 12, "topic_name": "Mortgage loan modifications", "topic_prob": 0.19448970616586495}, "2": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.1450898683333832}, "3": {"topic_idx": 8, "topic_name": "Taking out or refinancing mortgage", "topic_prob": 0.10244088430667775}, "4": {"topic_idx": 25, "topic_name": "Communication by phone", "topic_prob": 0.05652961122922435}}}, {"Original narrative": "Nationwide Building society Fraud department  on 080046403051 today i had to contact this department regarding a payment I had been tricked into paying after speaking to the halifax I was told to contact NWBC the operator call Caroline was very combatant  and was talking over me telling what had happened on a case I had not given her any information on at all. when i asked not to be so combatant and please pass me to a manager in a very low tone under her breath you could here her saying the words F**** Sake ? is this the type of person that have dealing with old people that have been the victims of a fraud ? this is disgraceful when i was then put on hold but know one picked up the phone  On recalling I was then greeted with other operators that seem to want to stick together trying to cover each others backs no managers available followed with am a supervisor Can I help followed by I dont think she would have said that and further down the line sorry if that was said what a total wast of a phone call been scammed out of \u00a330 then sworn at by a building society operator that is there to help .", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 39, "topic_name": "Contacting company", "topic_prob": 0.5367743813069463}, "1": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.2306190870268543}, "2": {"topic_idx": 42, "topic_name": "Fraudulent transaction", "topic_prob": 0.0832075699071791}, "3": {"topic_idx": 34, "topic_name": "Fraud and identity theft", "topic_prob": 0.07479387263560923}, "4": {"topic_idx": 43, "topic_name": "Information about late payments", "topic_prob": 0.019422067233339484}}}, {"Original narrative": "I love nationwide.I got a text from Nationwide saying there may be fraudulent activity on my account - the account had been emptied before I even realised I didn't have my bank card.

We went to an independent mortgage broker who found that Nationwide were offering us the best rate for a mortgage. We applied with them and my partner and I were required to send our original bank statements and pay slips which we did. I sent these by recorded delivery and in a few weeks got them back. Unfortunately the house sale was taking place over Christmas which means many places were closing down over the holiday period which caused some delay. Anyway Nationwide then informed us that they had lost the photocopies of our original documents and I had to send them again. This time I did it in branch but this caused so much delay with the house sale that the estate agents were threatening to put the house back on the market even though we had paid a reservation fee. I made an official complaint and some dunce of an employee offered me as a goodwill gesture the price of the postage to send the documents to them which added up to a whopping...\u00a33.75! I l laughed at this and as this was such a paltry amount they did decide to give me a bit more around the \u00a325 mark but I wasn't impressed by the way my complaint had been dealt with and it was escalated to someone else who did offer a more sincere apology and about \u00a3100 in compensation for nearly costing us the sale of the house.Apart from this I have also found Nationwide to be a very cold, uncaring and unfeeling building society. I went through a difficult financial time when I was made redundant and I was struggling with my bills which meant I was relying on my overdraft. I spoke to Nationwide about my difficulties and asked if it was possible not to charge so much interest on the overdraft as I was unemployed and could not afford the charges but had to temporarily rely on my overdraft to cover necessary bills. I was sure I would find employment soon as I have never been out of work for very long. What I got was an extremely sneering letter offering no sympathy and which was quite accusatory in the sense that I was told it is my responsibility to sort myself out and it is not their problem and that they were already being very generous. I couldn't believe how harsh the letter was and it actually made me cry being spoken to like that and I did make a complaint but guess what? I never heard anything back.They also kept sending me letters every week advising me to take a loan out with them and and I mean EVERY week. They also said that because I was already a Nationwide customer, they would offer me a special rate. So I decided to take them up on their offer and when I got another of their letters for the loan I accepted and filled in some details. I was then called in to branch to discuss the loan further only I was turned down. When I asked why they advised it was because I was using my overdraft but I asked did they not see this when I was being sent the letters through the post that quite clearly were addressed to me and personalised to offer me a special rate? No apparently..Their complaints procedure is very poor indeed and they do not take the time to actually care about their customers. I hate all banks and building societies to be honest. With Nationwide all they care about is getting their hands on your money and what you can do for them. When you need help and or need something from them, don't bother because you will get nothing in return.The joke is on us mugs, the customers. They simply do not care about their customers and they don't respond to my complaints.

Made the application through an independent financial adviser, who recommended them as a good lender for people in our situation (first time buyers). All seemed to be progressing well, valuation paid for- and then came the bombshell. Apparently Nationwide had decided to decline our application due to an issue on my wife's credit file, but would not reveal what this was. Our adviser, bless him, was left (in his own words) 'embarrassed' by Nationwide's 'extremely unprofessional' approach. He advised us to get on to Nationwide right away for a refund of the valuation fee- a fee, which, in his opinion, Nationwide should never have taken from us before they had completed the necessary credit checks, which evidently they hadn't done before relieving us of our valuation fee. Rather than go through the undoubted agony of trying to get sense out somebody at a call centre, I went directly to my local branch (High Wycombe). I should point out that I was an existing Nationwide customer of some 10+ years (savings) and never had an issue. Spoke to a helpful lady (possibly the only helpful person in the whole sorry enterprise?!), who allowed me to use the phone in branch to speak directly with the mortgage team. The person I spoke to first agreed that they would refund the valuation fee (\u00a3350) , before changing their mind- in the space of less than one minute?!. When I asked to speak to somebody more senior, I was informed by the person on the phone that there was 'no point'!. When I asked whether, in fact, the survey had actually taken place, I was informed that....'perhaps it had been, perhaps it hadn't'!. When I pointed out to this lovely individual that it was my money that had been spent on this exercise, and I had a right to know what the Nationwide had actually done with it, I was promptly hung up on! Being somebody that can take a hint(!), I promptly went to the counter to close my accounts. Lots of hand wringing from the senior person in the branch, lots of 'I do sympathise', and 'I can see where you're coming from', etc, but no actual practical action to try to remedy the situation. I have since been in contact with the Nationwide on many occasions to request repayment, this just results in me being passed from one clueless person to another, any request to speak to a manager either results in 'a manager won't be able to help you' , or being hung up on (after being on hold for an age!). I can only sympathise with others on this forum who have lost more than us, or missed out on a property they were trying to buy- all down to the Nationwide's incompetence/ dishonesty. Actually reading through some of the experiences on here, I'm left feeling that maybe we had a lucky escape, before we were fleeced of even more cash! So to anybody reading this, who may be considering having anything whatsoever to do with the Nationwide.....don't. Please, don't.

In 2009 of choice we made some overpayments to our mortgage account - overpayments may be requested back at any time. 3 days ago I rang to request the majority of those overpayments back - this just adds to our balance, and obviously increases interest payments. Three phone calls: me making the first one making the request and giving necessary details, including requesting quick transfer to our bank account (Not a NW a/c) for which we agreed to pay \u00a320; second call by husband authorising as joint account holder; third call by me again, requesting clarification of some ambiguity of information; quick transfer confirmed in all 3 calls.The money was due in our account today, Monday. NO! Not there! I rang NW, who admitted there had been \"A Mistake\" (3 times?!) and the money would not be going in today. The polite young man told me he could raise a complaint but could do nothing. I disagreed and requested to speak to the complaints manager myself. Following a delay I eventually spoke to the complaints manager and was told that a payment was \"in the system\" and would \"probably\" reach our bank account on Wednesday. (Strange, as 3 days ago I was told that without a quick transfer it would probably be Friday!). I stated that we did not therefore think a \u00a320 fee should be paid and this was confirmed. NW have held our overpayment money for over 7 years, but it seems that we have to accept very poor service to have it back (which is our right with any overpayment) with the excuse of a \"mistake\".My husband and I are frustrated with this inefficiency. Sadly, because our mortgage only has 3 years, 10 months to run, we cannot remortgage (we are on base rate) with another mortgage provider, so we are stuck with Nationwide.Staff on the telephone are pleasant, personable and apologetic, but there is a distinct lack of responsibility for the mistake and a reluctance to rectify to the customer's satisfaction. Apparently a complaint \"has been logged\" and I have been given an assurance of when I will be contacted; this Thursday,16th Feb. Watch this space. If NW do acknowledge that their administration is lacking, and award some sort of compensation, I will post it here.My advice is to AVOID NATIONWIDE. Your money is just that: YOUR MONEY, and a struggle to get it is demeaning. A Bank should be 100 per cent efficient: more important than polite staff agreeing with you on the telephone, but working for an institution unable or unwilling to give their customers enough respect to actually rectify mistakes.Incidentally, with 21st century practically instantaneous  money transfer electronically, WHY is the above payment of \u00a320 for a quick transfer necessary anyway? Does it have anything to do with the word INTEREST?POSTSCRIPT 16th Feb midday: yes, I have had the call from the complaints department. Very understanding: some discussion and acceptance of the error, and suggestions on my part as to how this sort of mistake could be avoided: for example by email confirmation, as used by other organisations immediately post telephone conversation. I was offered compensation of \u00a340: more than I  expected, which I have accepted.

I am in a financial position where my family are unable to fund me at university therefore all my money come from either a student loan or the many hours I work at my job. In my second year of university due to circumstances I had to apply to increase my overdraft. In response Nationwide decided to cut my overdraft by \u00a3500 immediately after, due to this money not being in my account (thus the overdraft application) I was forced into a monthly reduction which consequently damaged my credit score badly, which I have spent years building by carefully taking credit out and not missing a single payment to date. This in turn prevented any possibility of transferring to a student friendly bank, similar to a trap. Shortly after this incident Nationwide released a student specific flex account based around student overdrafts with 0% interest, after seeking to apply for this account I was told I am not eligible due to being an existing student, despite over six years of banking with Nationwide and their awareness I am a student, this option wasn't around while I was applying to university. Third year comes on by and I am finally allowed to extent my overdraft again after explaining I needed some extra funding to allow me to source a car for commuting to university as living away is too expensive and a loan is not an option due to the damage their repayments caused to my credit score. Obviously this came with fairly high interest also. Not even 4 months pass and Nationwide decides to yet again cut my overdraft this time by \u00a3600 pounds, this is the remainder of my loan only a few weeks since it was received. After calling to enquire I was told it was based on a credit check, which I have also done and rank excellent with Experian.

They believed her made up story and without investigation or his side of the story, they took his money and paid it to her even though one of their agents stated that this is civil dispute and they cannot get involved. They ignored his complaints, his requests, his questions. They refused to investigate the sister's breach of confidentiality and data protection and even stated that she doesn't work there. What a lie. He was the only provider and all the money came only from him for last 21 years (she never worked). They put impersonation (of himself??) on his account and made a debt of \u00a35000 on his credit card that they are now demanding plus interest. It is now with Ombudsman. Ex-wife now \u00a35000 richer, also stole more money from accounts but no one cares to investigate that and she still demands more and still keeps threatening. Considering taking Nationwide to court and in process of telling the story via media. There is no justice for the man that has been falsely accused and is constantly being harassed, threatened and discriminated against. If there was one intelligent person in that bank, this wouldn't have happened as the evidence in his defence is clear. The manager of the complaints department cannot even write in English. My English is not perfect (I am a foreigner) but hers was not acceptable for someone in her position. I would steer away from this bank as this man was treated unbelievably unfairly. Basic human rights to defend himself were just taken away and because of his gender he was not even listened to, what a discrimination. I am not even talking about the debts he has to pay to strangers that helped him whilst stranded abroad and in addition the bank debt...that he will fight against!!! He will get his justice!!!

I hit the key to agree.

I filled in the amount knowing full well that the sum would cover it.    The screens then went on to do you accept the switch? You have so many days to cancel etc.  I accepted.The whole process was simply and straight forward.  I even commented to my partner how easy it had been and how quick the credit  check was.I then received letters to state welcome and that should you have an overdraft then all the amounts would be paid off etc etc. Very generic with no specific this account is XYZ with this borrowing facility etc.I got all of my cards and pins and card readers.  I also received texts telling me that all was progressing an all amounts would be transferred by the 31/10/16  On the 31st I received a text stating that the old account was now closed and that all the transfers had been carried out.    So I decided to check my old account online and make sure it was dead.  It was still there with the overdraft still showing!!!  I then checked my new account and saw that they had taken a small deposit I had made and transferred it but had made no effort to clear the old overdraft with my new one.I contacted the call centre, eventually spoke to a supervisor who told me I had never been offered the overdraft.   She didn't understand why as the credit score was impeccable but during the online process I had been declined.  To this date they are still suggesting I misread a page and that I was never offered the facility.  I am not in the habit of missing vital information and it has had me questioning my sanity.    I have asked them to recall my webpages but they cannot, I have asked them to show me each page as it appears during the process but they cannot.

After 12 years holding our mortgage with Nationwide we applied for further borrowing to extend and improve our house.  After weeks waiting for a face to face appointment (being advised on the phone when I called the branch to go online as it would be a lot easier) my husband and I got our mortgage review at the branch, although nobody told us it would be an video call.  Once we adjusted to the new circumstances and after spending over two hours reviewing our situation, the advisor gave us a decision in principle saying that it would take 4-6 weeks for an application to go through if we wanted to borrow the amount we needed to start work in our house.  He also said ti would be easier and quicker to access forms online.  This was further confirmed when I called my local branch some two months later so my husband and I did so.  We completed application forms for Further Borrowing send all the documents requested and received a confirmation email from nationwide saying that they would contact us if there were any problems.  As we did not hear anything, three weeks later I called Nationwide and it turns out that there had been an issue and nobody contacted us or processed the application so three weeks were wasted.  By now the builder is ready to review the contract before signing it.  We tried getting an appointment and after hours of waiting on hold, they are always very busy, I was passed through a number of receptionists who tried to do something and advisors unable to advise us.  The length of time for our application to be processed grew from 2-3 weeks to 3-4 weeks to 4-8 weeks.

And he was simply fed up. I finally applied for a mortgage with another advisor, but I had no feedback for 3 weeks, but then they called me and kept asking for the same evidences to be submitted. I had to chase them every week and submit evidences no less than 4 occassions, it was holding up my application. I still did not hear from my case handler! and never knew who it was even till this date! but I was told my file had gone to 4 different people and then finally I called them a month later, I was told that they were not sure of the progress and they need to call me back, the advisor had to speak to 4 people and then the advisor told me that they faulted the mortgage! I was not aware until when I had called to see the progress!, in fact Adam mentioned that it faulted 7 days ago and they are just waiting to get back to me!

Back in July 2013 they promised me \u00a350 when switching my current account (I didn't do it for this purpose tho), after 2 months I enquire do about it as I was told I will be given that amount of money and why not? So in November of 2013 (4 months after switching my account) I claimed the \u00a350 surprisingly I was told in my local branch (Loughton branch) that I wasn't entitled to it??!!! What? How come? It was then my on a mission to prove to them that the \u00a350 were mine and that Nationwide wasn't going to leg me over... Anyway the time passed by and I kept a minimum contact with the bank/branch as I was never comfortable as the service I ever received was poor and miss guiding.... On the 29th of Jan occurred to me and for business circumstances I had to apply for a credit card which I needed active and available by the 25th of February (I was offered a credit card by this society which I declined as I never liked credit cards) The advisor who started my application assured me that it shouldn't be any complication on having my credit card by the date I wanted it... On the 12th of February  I called the credit card department they had no idea about my application but they said to wait to be processed. On the 17th I called again and now worried that I won't have my credit card when I needed it enquired about my application again when I was told that the agreement was never received. The two people assisting me on the phone had feel my frustration and offered me to scan the application and send it by email which I did and my credit card was sent within 3 working days but now was too late as I went on holiday without a credit card and my renting card (paying with debit card) had costed me \u00a3150 more than if I would have paid with  credit card. I then raised a complaint and received a letter from Mr. John Doe saying that nationwide didn't do anything wrong (I'd say check the phone conversations that you record for \"monitoring and training services\" then judge), he also said to call him if I had any other query, which obviously I did but guess what his direct line was going straight to a voicemail which was given another number, when dialled this number gave me another number as wasn't available when duelling this last number Michelle said to call later as she wasn't availabl (yaaaay great service!!!) I then called to a switchboard when I was informed that they couldn't help me as they weren't aware of my complaint details... (thought fair enough but never expected it from such a big organisation)I would add another detail, my debit card stops working and starts randomly which means I have to carry cash with me all the time just in case! This has never happened to me with lloyds which I regret I have switched from.At this moment, I'm switching to Halifax which I have no idea how it's going to be but at least I'm switching from nationwide which is a big relief as they had caused me a big stress. Besides Halifax will give me \u00a3125 cash back as a reward which compensates the extra money I had to spend because of nationwide. By the way till today, although leaving a voicemail for the person who was dealings it's my complaint never contacted me which means Nationwide doesn't need you as customer. My advise to you, research and reresearch before you commit the mistake I have committed. Good luck!

They failed to change our life insurance despite consultations and form filling. This was only recognised 2 years later and they never admitted fault, a big complaint resulted in this.  The mortgage borrowing took 5 months even though we wasn't even moving we was just borrowing, they only seemed to do anything when I called.  Anyway recently due to to them getting the amount they could lend us wrong I had to pay my ex using a credit card.  Also due to having a child, and not getting a pay rise for 7 years, financially we have struggled.  I was ill after having my son 4 years ago, I went down the herbal route that thankfully worked, but this cost me \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3, I also changed my job so I didn't have to work nights as this was making me ill, it is a higher paid job, but I lost my unsocial hours that I knew would cost \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 until my increments went up, along with maternity leave, my partner reducing his hours for 1 year, and nursery fees (this also went up to \u00a38 k/year when I changed jobs) all this has equated in costing about \u00a370 k, I'm not complaining as we're out the other side, but unfortunately with \u00a340 k on credit card.  We have \u00a3120 k equity in the house, earn \u00a365 k per year have never not paid anything, therefore I would consider us a good couple to lend to.  We live in a large 4 bedroom house that we can sell in 3 years when my 2 children go to University, at this time we will be able to buy a small house outright.  We applied on 18 November for this money, it was referred, they said it would take 5 days, it took 27.  They only did things when I called them, which was every day at the end to the point they declined.  The reason they declined is because we have debt and we have spent too much and giving us the money would not solve the problem.  As you can see there is a very valid reason why we have the debt as described above that is not a problem anymore and believe me it will solve the problem!!! We have been penalised because we have been with Nationwide for so long not because we can't afford it.  So this is now a message to Nationwide goodbye any bank will be happy to lend us \u00a3200 k on a 300 k house!!!

As a student with a flex account, I thought I was able to reap many rewards such as phone insurance.This is my biggest complaint and what has made me consider switching banks.Okay, so here's how it is. With the account policy, I get phone insurance for two incidents a year. Unfortunately, I lost my pristine iphone 6, which is something totally out of character for me. After paying a \u00a3100 excess fee, I thought it was going to get replaced with either a refurbished, new or possibly cash settlement (as it states in its policy, yet everyone on the customer service board argues that's not the case).So my replacement phone came and guess what, it didn't work. Why? Well, I'm a rather tech savvy individual and I checked in with apple and used software on my computer to find there was a hardware issue. The serial and IMEI number on the back of the phone (its engraved in almost unreadable letters) said that it was a new phone with 360 days warranty with apple. Great, take it to apple to get switched - they won't touch it because the screen and possible other components aren't apple parts and therefore voids warranty - and trust me, they were very, very keen to talk with the policy holders at Nationwide for providing a phone with what otherwise suggests its new when its not. That wouldn't of bothered me, but I'm pretty sure there's a fraud law suite here for not informing me it was a refurbished phone as well as not etching out and replacing the serial and IMEI number and otherwise presenting it as new. Also, they provided damaged, unusable goods when I paid \u00a3100 for you know, a working phone. Where is the standards checks at least for these refurbished phones? Probably non existent.So after 2 days and several hours with customer services demanding I was sent either a brand new phone or some form of cash settlement, (because they insisted nothing was wrong with the phone they sent me but, bare in mind, I got passed through to 8 different people, two of which were meant to ring me back within the hour and never did) they finally came today and replaced the phone. With guess what, another refurbished phone without telling me what it was, and the guy on the phone guaranteeing it would be a brand new iphone from their stock. How can I tell? If you compare the headphone jack and charging port with any other phone its clear these aren't the right parts due to colour, placement and metal quality. Whether it will work over time or not we'll find out but beware Nationwide and LifestyleChoices I'll be straight on you plaguing hell. But it's pretty bad how the box came with nothing in it either (not even manuals and the key to open the sim card tray, thanks nationwide).So all in all, don't trust nationwide flex plus account, more so their insurance policies with Lifestyle Choices (the sublet company that the insurance is taken out with). Their knock off liars who just send you knock off products in return that don't even work and insist it's me with the problem; because you know, none of my degrees with technology account for anything. And will argue for hours that they do not provide a cash settlement when its on policy 4, point 5 of their hand booklet both online and on paper.Will be looking to change banks after Christmas, I have no faith in them what so ever now and will be launching a written complaint to Nationwide and then Ombsed for some sort of compensation.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.2649690030164595}, "1": {"topic_idx": 25, "topic_name": "Communication by phone", "topic_prob": 0.17688526253810727}, "2": {"topic_idx": 35, "topic_name": "Insurance and customer protections", "topic_prob": 0.1172132416737515}, "3": {"topic_idx": 5, "topic_name": "Access to bank account", "topic_prob": 0.08542759056657165}, "4": {"topic_idx": 42, "topic_name": "Fraudulent transaction", "topic_prob": 0.06977990586331403}}}, {"Original narrative": "With the new Help to Buy ISA out this week I was keen to move my current cash isa from natwest to nationwide as their interest rates are much better.

I have never missed a payment and have never taken a mortgage holiday ,have no overdraft, i already own half my house but still here i am still waiting for a decision which will only come after i have been strapped to a chair with them shining a torch in my face. This is disgusting treatment and i advise to stay away and i will be taking my money to a much better company when i remortgage.", "topics": {"0": {"topic_idx": 30, "topic_name": "Customer support", "topic_prob": 0.3860032052747071}, "1": {"topic_idx": 8, "topic_name": "Taking out or refinancing mortgage", "topic_prob": 0.13759123911760562}, "2": {"topic_idx": 11, "topic_name": "Issues with payments", "topic_prob": 0.10871945480866392}, "3": {"topic_idx": 21, "topic_name": "Closing home sales", "topic_prob": 0.09337496546116414}, "4": {"topic_idx": 2, "topic_name": "Signing contracts", "topic_prob": 0.06668466476691691}}}, {"Original narrative": "Whatever has happened to Nationwide?

I was so close to having this problem sorted out but NO nationwide refused to let me call santander while they were on the phone (santander agreed they'd be happy to do this but not gd ol nationwide). So i'm not waiting for a 2nd trace via nationwide and have been promised they'll resolve the issue (again).

Needless to say i went to town on her a** as i've worked in the industry before so i KNOW thats not true. if anything data must be held for 6 months min or can induce a data protection act fine.  bottom line - - if you don't check your bank account every day, nationwide may just remove money from your account and not tell you about it. They definitely are terrible at resolving the issue when you do catch em. - if you get through to someone useless on customer service, chances are their supervisors are just as useless.

The account, while I had access, did not show as a pending deposit or transaction per there website.  Inadvertently deposited the money again since it was not showing as being deposited in the acct.  Two days later my acct is frozen, funds are frozen, unable to set up direct deposit, NOTHING as they want to \"verify my identity\" via mail or e-mail first.  I send ALL information they request, the same day.  A week later, no response.   I call, still unable to verify my identity, PLUS, they say that I ounces a check because I wrote a bad check.

So, now it's 5/8/2015 and I call to find out what is going on and I'm told that it was to be closed on 5/1/15 but it hasn't happened and she will have to find out but not sure when she will be able to get an answer for me... What????  She goes on to tell me that they would have to close this acct and see if they could open another acct for me since the initial acct had a bad check on it...what????  The reason why is because the acct that I had opened was linked to an incentive acct, had I kept the acct open for 6 months, I would have been paid $200, now why would they want to treat me decent and pay out $200, like that is a lot of more money for them.  For one, I have had an acct with them for about a month, that has been frozen for the entire time except for about 2 days.... Why would I want to keep an acct with a bank like that????
