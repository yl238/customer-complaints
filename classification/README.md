# Classification of Complaints
A few experiments on predicting complaint product type using complaint text. Shouldn't take the code here too seriously, but didn't want to remove them all.

- `predict_debt_issues.py`: Try to predict a subset of issues in the 'debt' product, using LR and RF
- `predict_debt_issues.py`: Same as above, except with an LSTM
