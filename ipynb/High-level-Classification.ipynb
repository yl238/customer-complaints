      "Narrative:  My name is XXXX XXXX. I took my loans out when I was a student at XXXX University. I was an education major and upon graduation got a job at XXXX XXXX XXXX at which point I began to repay my loans. At the time my loans we're being serviced by XXXX. I consolidated my loans as per the advice of the company servicing my loans. XX/XX/XXXX my loans we're handed over to navient which is where they are being serviced now. I reached out several times about the federal loan forgiveness program in which I was advised I would be eligible for however after making payments all of which we're on time from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I was just made aware that I am not eligible by Navient. I received and continue to receive incorrect or inaccurate information from Navient which is now leading me away from being eligible for the student loan forgiveness program I was trying to be part of. I have tried to call the federal student loan forgiveness program to see if there is anything I can do however when I consolidated my loans apparently I needed to do so under a different loan category called direct loan. I was obviously never made aware of this when I made the decision and was never made aware of this even after I made this decision. Only now, did Navient make me aware however they also said that my 120 payments that I made which would qualify me for the forgiveness program would be reset if I re-consolidated to direct loans. I feel so disappointed that the company hired to service my loans and act on behalf of my best interest is not and did not do so when the timing was so crucial. Unfortunately, there is no company or department out there that is able to hold companies like this accountable for their lack of knowledge or for providing customers with incorrect information. It seems to me that I am not the only person that was mislead. The problem is now that according to Navient and the Federal Loan forgiveness dept, it is too late to make any changes that will allow me to be eligible.\n",

      "Narrative:  I have owned my home for 18 years and am facing foreclosure because my mortgage bank Ocwen Loan Servicing refuses to work with me, talk with me, or acknowledge my attempts at fixing the problem. I was overwhelmed with unexpected expenses a little over a year ago and it led to me being short on my finances and I missed the mortgage payment. I began trying to work this out with Ocwen, but they refused to speak with me and told me that my case was on hold so they could not talk to me about it. I did not know what this meant, and despite trying repeatedly over the next few months never got any straight answers. Meanwhile, I kept falling farther and farther behind. This could have been resolved after only a couple of missed payments because my financial crisis had passed. Eventually I found out that because I was in an unrelated bankruptcy action that Ocwen had determined that they could not talk with me about my delinquent mortgage payments. No one explained to me how or why this worked, or let me know that all that was needed was an authorization in order to discuss this. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the time this was figured out I was already in foreclosure. I have tried to engage with Ocwen and get them to work with me towards a modification but instead of doing so they are scheduling a sale date. I have the resources to afford a fair rate and payment. My current interest rate ( 8.55 % ) is very high and I deserve the chance to be considered for all government, state and internal programs. This could all be avoided if Ocwen were to follow the rules and negotiate with me in good faith. \n",

I began trying to resolve this matter with Ocwen and asked to be considered for a modification. As explained, their agents would not discuss this matter with me, because of an unrelated bankruptcy that had been filed in XX/XX/2013. This had nothing to do with my late mortgage payments that I was trying to fix with Ocwen -- -once I got the hold removed on my case I expected that Ocwen would work with me to get a new review started. That was not the case. I still did not have an assigned account manager, I still did not get my questions answered and I was transferred from one department to the next and could not make any progress. This is very disheartening. Ocwen received billions of dollars in government aid from the taxpayers and they have a record of engaging in questionable foreclosure and servicing practices. All I am asking for is a chance to be considered for these homeowner assistance programs that were set up to help people such as myself. I feel that Ocwen is putting profit before people, which is especially galling considering my military service that kept this bank safe and secure.\n",

      "First, it is impossible to make any kind of instant one-time payment without incurring a fee for making an additional payment, regardless of payment format. You CAN send a check in, but that will not reflect the interest charged during transit and before review. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I want to pay off my loan early, I have to modify my recurring payment and wait until the auto-payment day comes. But heres where the real headache comes in. After spending 45 minutes on hold both on the phone and via their online chat, XXXX told me that they could not provide me with a full payoff amount. Thus, by the time my recurring loan payment goes through on, say, 15 days later, it will not be enough because of the 15 days of interest. But wait, theres more. XXXX will NOT let you set up a recurring payment for more than you owe on the day you set up the payment. \n",
      "\n",
      "What does this mean for me? On XX/XX/XXXX, I wanted to pay off my entire {$3500.00} loan, so I set up a recurring payment for the next available date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I was only able to set it up for {$3500.00} because that was the amount I owed on XX/XX/XXXX. Of course, today, XX/XX/XXXX, the amount I now owe is about {$3500.00}. So now I owe {$50.00} which will continue to accumulate interest. I can keep my recurring payment of {$3500.00} set up, which will take care of that {$50.00}, but then I have to wait 6-8 weeks before XXXX cuts me a check for my {$3400.00} overpayment. Well thats not going to work, so I modify the auto payment once again for {$50.00}. Of course by the time the auto payment kicks in I really owe {$55.00}, so now I need to await for another auto payment ( and further accumulation or interest ) before the full amount is paid off. \n",

      "So, rather than pay off everything on XX/XX/XXXX, Im now forced to wait until sometime in XX/XX/XXXX just to pay off my XXXX loan.

I told them that their custom is to send the Affidavit over with the Investor 's Approval Letter. They then responded that they had all needed documents to review the file. Two weeks passed, and I followed up with them. They then stated they needed a document signed by the real estate agent, and forwarded the document to us. We had that document signed and returned to them within 48 hours, and again, they stated that that was the last document needed to complete the file. \n",
      "Two weeks later, we followed up and they asked us if the listing agent and the buyer were related. We told them they were not, however, the Arm 's Length Affidavit is the document that is needed to confirm that, a document which SPS sends over with their Investor Approval Letter. They said they would send it with the approval letter on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, that became XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, we were told XX/XX/XXXX.  On XX/XX/XXXX, they again asked if the listing agent and the buyer were related, and we again had the conversation about the Arm 's Length Affidavit. They said the approval would be ready within 48 hours. On XX/XX/XXXX, that became Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, they demanded that the Arms Length Affidavit be signed BEFORE granting the approval letter. I told them that is not how SPS operates : that the approval letter has the Arms Length Affidavit attached to it. They said they would send the documents to me. On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX CST, with no documents in hand, I called and was transferred to a manager, XXXX XXXX , who has kept me on hold \" researching '' the situation for over an hour. She has told me, on this phone call, 1 ) the document can not be sent to me because the approval is \" conditional, '' but that she wants me to find the document online via the SPS website and send them to her. 2 ) They are not on the SPS website and that I should \" XXXX '' them. After I \" XXXX '' them and found the SPS Arm 's Length Affidavit attached to an Approval Letter, proving that what I have been saying for the past SIX WEEKS was accurate, she then put me on hold for seven minutes and told me that she would put in a request to fax me the Arm 's Length Affidavit. This is what I was told on XX/XX/XXXX - that the document would be faxed to me. I am currently holding while she figures out if she can actually fax the document to me herself. \n",

Also, as part of the proof, Carter Young sent a copy of my driver 's license picture, which was taken as part of a promotion during my visit of their client 's premises.

The response came from XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was unable to respond to the response in a timely manner due to illness. I am now bringing this complaint against XXXX XXXX as representative for Ocwen for defamation of character of myself and my husband in her response to the complaint. It is filled with lies and she is aware the statements are lies. \n",
      "1. In her response to our statement that XXXX XXXX ( the prior servicer of our loan ) did not apply payments for over 6 months, she said that we did not make payments in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX so XXXX held our payments in suspense. \n",
      "XXXX XXXX is quite aware that there were no payments due in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX per the XXXX XXXX XXXX. This agreement recast the XXXX and XXXX interest and added it to the principal and the first payment of the modification was due on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The contract is a simple, clear, unambiguous contract that states the above. Seeing as she is a practicing attorney it would be proper to believe that XXXX XXXX is capable of reading a simple contract. Other business records such as the payment records and the phone records support the contract and that no payment was due for XXXX of XXXX of XXXX. \n",
      "2. In response to our statement that Ocwen/Saxon has been trying to steal our home she states that our statement is false because we continue to live in the house while we fight the litigation after our default. We did not actually default. We stopped paying the mortgage payment for 2 reasons. 1-because we are exercising our right under the material breach of contract laws and 2-because the damages caused by this breach devastated us financially and we had no way to pay anything and were forced to let the matter go to court so we could countersue for material breach of contract. It is the mortgage holder that initially delayed the litigation for almost 4 years after the initial filing of the foreclosure because they did nothing. They did nothing because they were in the wrong. The case went through a couple of law firms before XXXX XXXX XXXX took on the case. My guess would be because other firms did not want stoop to falsifying evidence to defend a corrupt client. But XXXX XXXX does not seem to have a problem with it. \n",
      "3. In response to our statement that Ocwen materially breached the contract XXXX XXXX states we breached our mortgage and note. NO WE DID NOT. We have evidence and facts that show that XXXX breached the contract in a way that can be construed a material ; they did not apply on time payments from the inception of the XXXX XXXX XXXX for many months and not until an attorney got involved. As soon as we discovered our legal recourse we took action under the belief that their actions constitute a material breach of contract. Ocwen accepted the prior actions of XXXX when they took on the servicing of the loan. \n",
      "4. In response to our statement that there were no payments due in XXXX or XXXX XXXX she lies and says there were payments due. Again we can revert to the very simple reading of a contract and common sense. We entered into a XXXX XXXX agreement in XXXX XXXX. We negotiated this agreement because of financial hardship. The modification required a down payment in XXXX XXXX that was clearly paid per all records, BUT WAS UNAPPLIED. The contract clearly states that the interest for the XXXX and XXXX payments was to be recast and ADDED TO THE PRINCIPAL. The contract also clearly states the first modification payment due is XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The phone records concur with the phrase next due XXXX dated in XXXX. Yet XXXX XXXX states we owed 2 FULL, unmodified payments in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX that we didnt pay. \n",
      "XXXX XXXX states the contract says that a payment was due XXXX XXXX, XXXX. She conveniently fails to state the rest of what the contract states in reference to a payment on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It clearly states that the payment for XXXX XXXX is to be paid by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It was XXXX payment due by XXXX XXXX that the contract CLEARLY states. That was part of the modification terms. We fell behind in XXXX due to confusion about the modification process. To get approved we had to pay XXXX XXXX payment by XXXX XXXX, XXXX, make a down payment in XXXX XXXX and get the paperwork in by a specific date in XXXX XXXX. \n",
      "In XXXX XXXX lie, we were required to pay a down payment, 2 unmodified payments for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and XXXX payment for the modification to be due on XXXX XXXX. \n",
      "Anyone who has had a modification or a refinance or a mortgage knows that there is a month or 2 before a payment becomes due. With XXXX XXXX logic we would have been paying more than our mortgage payments to get a modification to help us in a financial hardship. How would that help? There would be no point. Basic common sense and contract law refute her lies. \n",
      "This is just another lie ; twisting the truth to defame us 5. In response to our statement that our credit has been damaged she refers to credit reporting after XXXX when we stopped performance of the contract due to their material breach. Although this isnt a straight up lie her response is meant to defer and defame. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our statement was based on the negative credit reporting in XXXX when we were paying as required and XXXX was not applying our payments and was reporting them as late payments to the credit bureaus. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. In response to our statement that XXXX XXXX committed perjury in his affidavit XXXX XXXX states that he did not commit perjury. Let me refer to the XXXX law dictionary definition of perjury : The willful assertion as to a matter of fact, opinion, belief, or knowledge, made by a witness in a judicial proceeding as part of his evidence, either upon oath or in any form allowed by law to be substituted for an oath, whether such evidence is given in open court, or in an affidavit, or otherwise, such assertion being known to such witness to be false, and being intended by him to mislead the court, jury, or person holding the proceeding. \n",
      "\n",
      "In XXXX XXXX affidavit he asserts his knowledge and expertise in accounting for Ocwen. It would be proper to believe that someone of his expertise would be able to read a simple contract that sets out the requirements of our financial obligations to the mortgage holder. \n",
      "So he is either lying about the accounting or he is lying about his credentials. Both are perjury by definition. \n",
      "\n",
      "It becomes clear in his accounting when he starts out stating that we are delinquent by 2 payments in XXXX but suddenly in XXXX we are no longer delinquent yet we did not make any extra payments ; only 1 per  month. He did not explain how we suddenly were no longer delinquent without extra payments. But the payment records show how XXXX applied the previously unapplied payments in XXXX. And that is how we magically were no longer delinquent. Unfortunately we had already suffered irreparable damages within that 8 month time frame that coincides with the housing market crash of XXXX. \n",
      "\n",
      "Subornation of perjury is defined by XXXX XXXX XXXX as the offense of procuring another to take such a false oath as would constitute perjury in the principal. XXXX XXXX procured the affidavit of XXXX XXXX. It is only common sense to conclude that she committed subornation of perjury. \n",
