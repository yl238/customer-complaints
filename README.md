# Customer Complaint Analysis
A number of experiments to understand customer complaints

1. Segmentation - Supervised problem
2. Text summarization - Use Pagerank to condense long complaints
3. Topic modelling - LDA to identify complaint topics
4. Visualizations (Matt Pang)

The raw data can be found at the
[US consumer complaints database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database) website.
